# Blitz Search

Blitz Search is an external Tool that provides a dialogue for search much the same as JetBrains IDE's. Blitz Search is in Active development and seeking feedback.

The query format is words on a line based instead of literal by default.

# Blitz Search is both Fast and Readable:

# Blitz Search for Visual Studio now contains selectable Solution, Project, Active Files, Current file scopes.

These scopes, when selected, update in real time.

# Words on a line query is default

Using Modern C# as an example for a search that's hard with traditional search

```csharp
    var myListOfVegetables = new List<string>();
    List<string> myListOfVegetables = new();
    List<string> myListOfVegetables = new List<string>();
```

With Blitz Search the "vegetables new list" matches all of things, where with traditional Literal search or Regular Expression, this can be hard to do.


# Configurable Sets of Paths, with Icons to boldly Show what scopes you are looking at ( click image for example ).
